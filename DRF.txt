::There are three stages before creating a API through REST framework:
:::Converting a Modelâ€™s data to JSON/XML format (Serialization), 
:::Rendering this data to the view, Creating 
:::a URL for mapping to the viewset.
::Serializers allow complex data such as querysets and model instances to be converted to native Python datatypes
 that can then be easily rendered into JSON, XML or other content types. 
Serializers also provide deserialization, allowing parsed data to be converted back into complex types, after first validating the incoming data.
::@api_view:
    :::a decorater used for function based views
    :::used to make endpoints of that api(GET,POST,PUT,DELETE)
::REST is acronym for REpresentational State Transfer.
 It is architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems

::REST API are stateless that is The server will not store anything about the latest HTTP request the client made. It will treat every request as new.
   No session, no history.
::In REST api only once the suthorization is done the request 
    need not to send the authentication details at every REST API request
